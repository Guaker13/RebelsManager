The Rebellion Manager is the swiss knife online platform for national branches. It is currently used by:

* [Extinction Rebellion Belgium](https://www.extinctionrebellion.be)

Rebels joining the rebellion are added to decentralized databases, making the data available to national and local chapters coordinators. The Rebels Manager gives an overview of the rebellion activity to Extinction Rebellion International Support Team.

# Expected Features

* Local chapters and working groups management
* Customizable _Join the Rebellion!_ forms
* Encrypted email and phone number, never shown to coordinators
* Built-in mass emailing relying on [Mailtrain](https://mailtrain.org)
* Built-in mass text messaging
* Rebels tagging and segmentation by location, skills or affinities

# Main Goals

* Make it easy to manage local chapters and rebels
* Allow rebels to update their own details
* Gamify the rebellion by showing each and everyone progress as a rebel
